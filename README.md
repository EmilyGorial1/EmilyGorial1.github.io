**Hey :wave:, I'm Emily**

***I am going into my fourth year at UCSD as a Computer Science Major.***

:telescope: I'm currently working on the **Hate Speech Detection Project**

:file_folder: Projects I worked on:

* ðŸ““ **Developer Journal:** Worked together with my group of 11 software engineers to create a web application for software developers to keep track of their progress. I worked a lot with the styling, utilizing Figma and CSS to style the website as desired. I also worked on testing the software using E2E as well as unit tests to ensure everything runs properly.
* ðŸŽ® **Analyzing Safety Concerns on Roblox:** Worked collaboratively with my research group of 4 to gather Reddit data pertaining to children gaming on Roblox using a web-scraping script. We utilized NLP to clean text data from 12155 Reddit posts and prepare for further analyzation using Python. We then used Qualtrics to create a survey whic was later deployed on Prolific to confirm the parental concerns found by our analysis. I also created high-quality visualizations for the 100+ survey responses using libraries such as NLTK, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. Finally, we produced a paper, written in LaTex, as Early Research Scholars Program (ERSP) participants.
* :hospital: **Determining if Social Determinanats of Health may affect the outcome of Asthma:** I began by completing multiple training sessions to become a registered researcher on the All of US Researcher Workbench, a cloud-based platform that allows users to acess healthcare data that can be analyzed using Python. I spent the majority of my time gathering and pre-processing healthcare data using Pandas to prepare for analysis on the Social Determinants of Health. I then created a machine-learning model with predictive analytics and performed logistic regression as well as other univariate analyses to reveal that several Social Determinants of Health varbiables affected the likelihood of a patient having asthma. Finally, I presented my research findings at the 12th Annual UC San Diego DBMI Symposium. In this experience, I learned research basics, Python and R, Bioinformatics principles, and multivariate as well as univariate analysis, with no prior knowledge.
